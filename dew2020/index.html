                    <p> <b>Human annotated data is crucial for operationalizing empirical ways for evaluating, comparing, and assessing the progress of ML/AI research.</b> As human annotated data represents the compass that the entire ML/AI community relies on, the human computation (HCOMP) research community has a multiplicative effect on the progress of the field. Optimizing the cost, size, and speed of collecting data has attracted significant attention by HCOMP and related research communities. In the first to market rush with data, aspects of maintainability, reliability, validity, and fidelity of datasets are often overlooked. We want to turn this way of thinking on its head and highlight examples, case-studies, methodologies for excellence in data collection.</p>

                    <p>Panos Ipeirotis [Ipeirotis, 2010], one of the founders of the HCOMP research community, warned us that <b>crowdsourced data collection platforms had the structural properties of a market for lemons</b> [Akerlof, 1967]. Due to uncertainty in the notion of quality, the market focuses on price, resulting in an equilibrium state where the good sellers are priced out of the market and only lemons remain. The focus on scale, speed, and cost of building datasets has resulted in an impact on quality, which is nebulous and often circularly defined, since the annotators are the source of data and ground truth [Riezler, 2014]. While dataset quality is still the top concern everyone has, the ways in which that is measured in practice is poorly understood and sometimes simply wrong. A decade later, we see some cause for concern: fairness and bias issues in labeled datasets [Goel and Faltings, 2019], quality issues in datasets [Crawford and Paglen, 2019], limitations of benchmarks [Kovaleva et al., 2019, Welty et al., 2019] reproducibility concerns in machine learning research [Pineau et al., 2018, Gunderson and Kjensmo, 2018], lack of documentation and replication of data [Katsuno et al., 2019].</p>

                    <p>Currently, data excellence happens organically due to appropriate support, expertise, diligence, commitment, pride, community, etc. However, data excellence is more than maintaining a minimum standard for the ways in which we collect, publish or assess our data. It’s a metascientific enterprise of recognizing what’s important in the long term for science.</p>

                    <p>This workshop continues a series of <u><b>preceding workshops on related topics</b></u>:

                    Decades of catastrophic failures within high-stakes software projects (e.g., explosions of billion dollar spacecrafts in the 60s and 90s due to floating point overflows and missing hyphens in source code) have burnt the vital importance of upfront investments in <span style="color: white; font-weight: bold">software engineering excellence</span> into our collective memory. It was through careful post-hoc analysis of these kinds of disasters that software engineering has matured as a field and achieved a more robust understanding of the costs and benefits that come with: <span style="color: white; font-weight: bold">processes</span> like systematic code reviews, <span style="color: white; font-weight: bold">standards</span> like coding conventions and design patterns, <span style="color: white; font-weight: bold">infrastructure</span> for debugging and experimentation, as well as <span style="color: white; font-weight: bold">incentive structures</span> that prioritize careful quality control over hasty roll-outs.

                <p class="text-faded">
                    We invite scientific contributions and positions papers on the following topics:

                    <p class="text-faded"><span style="color: white; font-weight: bold">Maintainability</span>: Maintaining data at scale, e.g., Knowledge Graph [Bollacker et al, 2008] has similar challenges to maintaining software at scale, or potentially knowledge engineering. Data engineering often refers to data munging tasks, and is far more important and challenging that has been appreciated thus far. The fastest thing to do isn’t the most maintainable or reusable:
                    <ul class="text-faded">
                      <li>What lessons for maintaining data at scale could we learn or adapt from software and knowledge engineering at scale?</li>
                      <li>Methods and tools for data documentation (e.g., [Gebru, 2018]), management of owners/maintainers, forking/replication</li>
                      <li>Data should be not abandoned, should not be disposable</li>
                      <li>What if it is a one-off dataset?</li>
                        <ul>      
                          <li>There is no good software that is abandoned.</li> 
                          <li>Even a one-off dataset requires maintenance over time, extension to other languages, addition of new word pairs, updates, scrutiny.</li>
                          <li>How do we help other people to contribute to growing and improving this data</li>
                        </ul>      
                      <li>Open infrastructure for supporting maintenance and growth</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-faded"><span style="color: white; font-weight: bold">Reliability:</span> Reliability captures internal aspects of validity of the data, such as: consistency, replicability, reproducibility of data. Irreproducible data allows us to draw whatever conclusions we want to draw, while giving us the facade of being data-driven, when it is dangerously hunch driven:
                    <ul class="text-faded">
                      <li>Irreproducible data is not maintainable</li>
                      <li>Reliable mechanisms to account for the human aspects of data collection</li>
                      <li>Gathering data from humans requires acknowledging our humanity: frailty, subjectiveness, imperfections, knowledge gaps, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-faded"><span style="color: white; font-weight: bold">Validity:</span> Validity tells us about how well the data helps us explain things related to the phenomena captured by the data, e.g., via correlation between the data and external measures:
                    <ul class="text-faded">
                      <li>Does the specific operationalization of a data collection procedure (e.g., answering a certain question on a 5-point Likert scale) accurately represent and allow generalizations to the abstract construct that is being modeled (e.g., human sentiment reactions to sentences)?</li>
                      <li>Was the construct properly defined before it was operationalized (e.g., getting convicted of a crime is not necessarily equivalent to having committed the crime)?</li>
                      <li>Does the data operationalization account for potential complexity, subjectivity, multi-valence or ambiguity of the intended construct?</li>
                      <li>Does the data operationalization predict features of the represented construct (e.g., education research tries to explore whether grades are valid by studying its correlations to external indicators of success)?</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-faded"><span style="color: white; font-weight: bold">Fidelity:</span> Users of data often assume that the dataset accurately and comprehensively represents the phenomenon, which is almost never the case. For example, if the sentences in a sentiment corpus were sampled from Wikipedia, it might not work as well as news headlines required by the product: 
                    <ul class="text-faded">
                      <li>Importance of a balanced / unbiased / representative dataset</li>
                      <li>Sampling, e.g:</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Temporal splitting can introduce bias if not done right in cases such as signal processing or sequential learning.</li>
                        <li>User based splitting not keeping data of users separated is a potential bias source. E.g. if data from the same user is in test and train sets.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <li>Does the dataset live up to scientific standards of data collection?</li>
                      <li>Correlation between the data and external measures or objective outcomes</li>
                      <li>Problem of circular data validation (i.e., validating data by itself)</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3 class="text-center">What Do Our Models Learn?</h3><br>
                <p>
                    Large-scale vision benchmarks have driven—and often even defined—progress in machine learning. However, these benchmarks are merely proxies for the real-world tasks we actually care about. How well do our benchmarks capture such tasks?
                    <br><br>
                    In this talk, I will discuss the alignment between our benchmark-driven ML paradigm and the real-world uses cases that motivate it. First, we will explore examples of biases in the ImageNet dataset, and how state-of-the-art models exploit them. We will then demonstrate how these biases arise as a result of design choices in the data collection and curation processes.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout, we illustrate how one can leverage relatively standard tools (e.g., crowdsourcing, image processing) to quantify the biases that we observe.

                <p>
                    Models trained on large unlabeled corpora of human interactions will learn patterns and mimic behaviors therein, which may include offensive or otherwise toxic behavior and unwanted biases. I will discuss several methods for mitigating these issues in neural dialogue models. In particular, I will highlight the use of iterative, adversarial human-and-model-in-the-loop data collection and model training procedures for the purpose of making chatbots robust to adversarial attack from humans. In opposition to static benchmarks, these approaches yield a “moving goalpost” for natural language understanding systems, and recent work shows that models trained on these increasingly complex tasks are more robust to adversarial attack.

                <h3 class="text-center">Asynchronous adjudication in labeling medical data: lessons, improvements and expansions</h3><br>
                <p>
                    Crowdsourcing has enabled the collection, aggregation and refinement of human knowledge and judgment, i.e. ground truth, for problem domains with data of increasing complexity and scale. A lack of comprehensive diagnostic reference standards in medicine significantly increases the complexity of labeling medical data. Asynchronous adjudication, a newly introduced method of facilitating asynchronous discussions among remote healthcare professionals, has enabled the generation of such ground truth, i.e. medical diagnoses,  with high quality at scale, and consequently, the development of machine learning based medical applications. 
                    <br><br>
                    In this talk, I will present the challenges of managing labellers, who often are medical experts, involved in asynchronously adjudicating medical labels. The discussion will focus on what information labellers find important to doing their jobs efficiently, and how such information impacts their work’s speed and quality. I next propose improvements to the current asynchronous adjudication mechanism. Last, I will describe a novel patented async adjudication expansion, designed and built to address the challenges of resolving disagreements among experts on visual annotations of medical images.

                    I received my Ph.D.in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Michigan, Artificial Intelligence Lab. From 2014 to 2018, I led and managed a data quality team of engineers and data scientists at Google Maps, responsible for building machine learning time-series models that detect and predict visit patterns useful in assisting users to plan their trips efficiently. We built innovative location-based systems for crowdsourcing users’ assessment about their physical surroundings in real time.  Since 2018, I have been leading a team tasked with developing a crowd-sourcing platform for medical labeling and diagnoses in Health, a new healthcare division at Google. The platform's output of high quality labeled data, generated securely and reliably at scale, is imperative to Google Health's efforts in building and deploying state-of-the-art machine-learning-powered diagnostic solutions, including ML models for diabetic retinopathy and breast cancer detection.

                <p>
                    The AI industry is collectively fielding tens of thousands of ML applications, many of which require human-labeled data (HLD) for training, evaluation or production “patching”. We identify business and operational challenges to producing high-quality HLD at scale, and review the pros and cons of common organizational solutions: outsourcing HLD to third-party vendors, insourcing HLD to a product or engineering sub-team, insourcing HLD to a specialized HLD function, letting science contributors fend for themselves, and hybrids of these.
